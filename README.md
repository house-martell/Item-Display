# Lulumelon

## Description
Lulumelon is a full stack application that I built with 2 other engineers. We aimed to replicate a Lululemon product page in both appearance and functionality. We used microservice architecture in vertical slices for scalability and separation of concerns.

I personally recreated the main product display section of the application. I focused on imitating the look and feel of the actual site as closely as possible. I recreated scroll, toggle boxes, and dropdown menu functionality and implemented responsive web design.
